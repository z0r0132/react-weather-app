## Deployment

Out of the box, this app is deployable by serving the `./dist` folder generated by `yarn build`. The simplest deployment strategy is a [static deployment](#static-deployments).

### Static Deployments

Serve the application with a web server such as express by pointing it at your `./dist` folder. Make sure to direct incoming route requests to the root `./dist/index.html` file so that the client application will be loaded.
